### üñ• OEM Monitoring
- Set up via **Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)**  

---

## üß™ Phase 5: Table Implementation & Data Insertion

This phase focused on converting the logical data model into a physical Oracle database by creating tables, inserting test data, and enforcing data integrity for reliable operations.

### 1. Table Creation
- Tables (`Customer`, `Trip`, `Transport`, `Accommodation`, `Booking`) were created based on the ERD.
- Each table includes appropriate columns, data types, and constraints.

## üéØ Objectives

- Perform **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE** and **CREATE, ALTER, DROP** operations
- Use **procedures, functions, and packages** to modularize logic
- Apply **cursors** and **exception handling** for secure data interaction
- Develop **testable queries** that reflect real-world business logic
- Implement **analytical procedures** using grouped data

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Operations (DML & DDL)

### ‚úÖ DML Examples
#### Insert Booking Record
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
  Customer_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
  Email VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  Phone VARCHAR2(15),
  Preferences CLOB
);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE Trip (
  Trip_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  Destination VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
  Duration NUMBER CHECK (Duration > 0),
  Price NUMBER(10,2) CHECK (Price > 0),
  Max_Capacity NUMBER NOT NULL
);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE Transport (
  Transport_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  Type VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
  Capacity NUMBER,
  Departure_Time TIMESTAMP,
  Price NUMBER(10,2)
);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE Accommodation (
  Accom_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR2(100),
  Location VARCHAR2(100),
  Room_Type VARCHAR2(50),
  Price_Per_Night NUMBER(10,2)
);
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE Booking (
  Booking_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  Customer_ID NUMBER REFERENCES Customer(Customer_ID),
  Trip_ID NUMBER REFERENCES Trip(Trip_ID),
  Booking_Date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE,
  Payment_Status VARCHAR2(20) CHECK (Payment_Status IN ('Pending', 'Completed', 'Cancelled'))
);

```

### 2. **Data Insertion**
- Realistic sample records were inserted to simulate real-world booking scenarios.
- Data included multiple trips, transport modes, room types, and booking statuses.

```sql
INSERT INTO Customer (Customer_ID, Name, Email, Phone, Preferences)
VALUES (1, 'Serge Shema', 'serge@email.com', '0782193530', 'Window seat');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO Trip (Trip_ID, Destination, Duration, Price, Max_Capacity)
VALUES (301, 'Kigali to Nairobi', 5, 400.00, 50);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO Transport (Transport_ID, Type, Capacity, Departure_Time, Price)
VALUES (201, 'Bus', 45, TO_TIMESTAMP('2024-12-01 08:00:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'), 50.00);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO Accommodation (Accom_ID, Name, Location, Room_Type, Price_Per_Night)
VALUES (101, 'City Hotel', 'Nairobi', 'Deluxe', 80.00);
```

```sql
INSERT INTO Booking (
  Booking_ID, Customer_ID, Trip_ID, Booking_Date, Payment_Statu) VALUES
(1001, 1, 301, TO_DATE('2024-12-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Pending');
```

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- Enforced via:
  - **Primary Keys**: Uniqueness of records
  - **Foreign Keys**: Relationship enforcement
  - **Constraints**: `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and `CHECK` for value validation

### 4. **Physical Database Structure**
- Fully implemented and normalized
- Indexed and optimized for query performance
- Designed to support the system‚Äôs booking, tracking, and reporting functions

---

## üìà Outcome

- A fully functional, relational database schema ready for transaction processing, user interaction, and advanced logic in future phases.

---

## üîÑ Phase 6: Database Interaction and Transactions  

This phase focused on enhancing system functionality through SQL operations, procedural logic, and modular programming using Oracle PL/SQL.

### 1. **DML & DDL Operations**
- Performed `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` on core tables like `Booking`, `Trip`, and `Customer`.

### 2. **Problem Statement & Analysis**
- Identified the need to track trip booking frequency and calculate total revenue per trip.
- Used `GROUP BY` and PL/SQL logic to analyze bookings.

### 3. **Procedures & Functions**
- Created procedures (e.g., `Show_Customer_Bookings`) to display customer-specific data.
- Built functions (e.g., `Calculate_Trip_Revenue`) to compute total revenue per trip.

### 4. **Cursors & Exception Handling**
- Used cursors to loop through pending bookings.
- Applied exception handling to prevent runtime errors.

### 5. **Packages**
- Grouped reusable procedures/functions in a package (`Booking_Pkg`) to confirm bookings and check statuses.

---

## üìà Outcomes

- Enhanced data interaction using modular PL/SQL.
- Improved error management and data consistency.
- Enabled reusable logic through packages for future scalability.

---

## üîê Phase 7: Advanced Database Programming and Auditing  

This phase focused on strengthening system security, automation, and accountability using advanced PL/SQL features like triggers, packages, and auditing mechanisms.

### ‚úÖ Key Activities

#### 1. **Problem Statement**
- The system needed to restrict table modifications during weekdays and public holidays.
- Goal: Prevent unauthorized changes and track all sensitive operations.

---

#### 2. **Trigger Implementation**
- **Simple Triggers**: Blocked `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` on weekdays.
- **Holiday Restriction**: Used a `Holiday_List` table to block changes during defined holiday dates.
- **Logic**: Trigger checks system day and holiday dates before allowing any DML operation.

---

#### 3. **Auditing & Access Control**
- Created an `Audit_Log` table to capture:
  - `User_ID`, `Action`, `Date_Time`, and `Status` (Allowed/Denied)
- Logged all booking-related operations through triggers.
- Used **functions and packages** to automate and track audit entries.

---

### üîê Outcomes

- Enhanced system security by restricting DML operations on sensitive days.
- Achieved full traceability of user actions.
- Improved accountability through centralized audit logging.
